# Kernel Generation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-25 22:55:23
**Operation:** subtraction (C = A - B)
**Model:** gpt-4o

## Note on RAG
The system prompt contains the complete knowledge base (API docs + addition example).
User prompts below are minimal - they just reference the RAG context.

## COMPUTE Kernel

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate a TT-Metal compute kernel for subtraction (C = A - B) (C = A - B).

Requirements:
- Look in the knowledge base and find the subtraction (C = A - B) API functions
- Follow the same pattern as the addition compute kernel
- Use circular buffers: CB_0 (input A), CB_1 (input B), CB_16 (output)
- Include comments explaining each step
- Filename: kernels/compute/subtract_2_tiles.cpp

## READER Kernel

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate a TT-Metal reader kernel for the subtraction (C = A - B) example.

Key insight: The reader is operation-agnostic (just reads data from DRAM).

Requirements:
- Follow the same pattern as the addition reader kernel
- Read two tiles from DRAM to CB_0 and CB_1
- Use NOC async reads with barriers
- Runtime args: arg 0 = src0 address, arg 1 = src1 address
- Filename: kernels/dataflow/reader_binary_1_tile.cpp

## WRITER Kernel

**User Prompt:**
```
Generate a TT-Metal writer kernel for the subtraction (C = A - B) example.

Key insight: The writer is operation-agnostic (just writes results to DRAM).

Requirements:
- Follow the same pattern as the addition writer kernel
- Write one tile from CB_16 to DRAM
- Use NOC async write with barrier
- Runtime arg: arg 0 = dst address
